## ML-Based Detection Project

This repo includes all the code of the models that i used throughout the whoe project. However, it only contains some of the final edits and doesnt 
include all of the changes that were made for some of the parts to test the model. To get it to run you will need a multitude of different librairies 
including the scikit-learn and some other smaller modules which are listed at the top of the code in the imports. Adding these will result in the models 
being able to be run.
